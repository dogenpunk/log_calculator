LogCalculator
=============

LogCalculator is used to calculate the number of hours that fall
within/out of a range of time (currently defined as 8am - 5pm). It
generates Ranges of Time objects and uses the intersection of these
ranges to determine the amount of time that falls within traditional
business hours.

This is really just an experiment to see if there's a saner way to model
overlapping periods of time. Because I hate thinking about that stuff.
